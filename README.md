# K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
We load a customer dataset related to a telecommunication company, clean it, use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of the model.

# Decision Trees
Load a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications. Use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

# Logistic Regression
Create a model with telecommunications data to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that you can take some action to retain the customer

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
build and train a model using human cell records, to classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant
